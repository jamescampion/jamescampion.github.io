    <p>I am a 22 year old Notre Dame grad. My passions include investing,
      understanding business models, listening Hip-Hop / EDM music,reading
      New Sincerity novels, and watching / playing sports.</p>

    <p>My programming skills are very lmited beyond a Python class in college,
      so I figured I would give this a try to learn!</p>
